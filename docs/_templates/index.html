<h1>Welcome to OpenBike's documentation</h1>
<div>
    <p>OpenBike is an open source bikesharing stack.
    It helps you to provide a modern, 24/7, (web)app based rental service for bikes and other vehicles.
    It includes open hardware for tracking devices attached to your bikes and provides adapter services for integrating different tracking and lock solutions.</p>

    <p>We aim to make our documentation as up to date, usable and
    complete as possible. We want you to be able understand, use, run, and
    improve OpenBike. That said, documentation is never finished, and rarely
    perfect. If there is anything unclear or missing in our documentation,
    we'd be happy if you'd <a href="https://github.com/transportkollektiv/openbike/issues/new">let us know</a>.</p>
