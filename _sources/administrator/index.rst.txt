Administrator documentation
===========================

You want to install OpenBike on your own server? That's great! We have
documentation for a standard installation in unprivileged local user
accounts, a docker-composed based setup, or even config for your kubernetes
cluster. Also we provide hints for additional systems you may want to deploy.
